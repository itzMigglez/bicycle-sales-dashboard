# 🚲 Bicycle Sales Data Analysis
### 📌 Project Overview
This project explores customer demographics and purchasing behavior from a Bicycle Buyers dataset. Using Excel, I analyzed variables such as marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, region, and commute distance to identify patterns that influence whether a customer purchases a bicycle.

The project demonstrates the use of data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboards to turn raw data into actionable business insights.
### 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

- Excel: data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboard creation
- Data Analysis: demographic segmentation, trend analysis
- Visualization: pivot charts, summary dashboard

### 📂Data Description

The dataset contains the following key columns:

- Marital Status – Married/Single
- Gender – Male/Female
- Income – Annual income
- Children – Number of children
- Education – Education level (e.g., Bachelors, Graduate Degree)
- Occupation – Clerical, Professional, Skilled Manual, etc.
- Home Owner – Yes/No
- Cars – Number of cars owned
- Commute Distance – Distance to work (e.g., 0–1 Miles, 5–10 Miles)
- Region – Geographic region (Europe, North America, Pacific)
- Age – Customer’s age
- Purchased Bike – Yes/No

### 📊 Key Insights

- Income: Customers with higher incomes were more likely to purchase bicycles.
- Commute Distance: Shorter commute distances correlated with higher bike purchases.
- Age: Middle-aged groups showed stronger interest compared to older demographics.
- Gender & Marital Status: Purchase likelihood varied across gender and family structures.
- Regional Trends: Certain regions had consistently higher purchase activity.
